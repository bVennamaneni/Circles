DESCRIPTION

This is a simple circle drawing application. When the user places one finger on the screen a circle is drawn on the screen. The center of the circle is placed where the user touched the screen.The longer the finger is pressed the bigger the circle becomes. The user can put multiple circles on the screen by touching it multiple times. It supports up to 15 different circles on the screen at a time.

* The drawing area for the circles is entire screen. 
* The user can set a circle in motion by placing a finger on a circle and swiping in any direction.
* The circles will start moving in direction and velocity indicated by the swipe. 
* Different circles can be moving in different directions with different speeds.
* When a circle reaches the edge of the screen it will bounce off the edge properly, i.e., it will lose some velocity and take into account the angle it strikes the edge. 
* Uses the accelerometer sensor to modify the direction and velocity of a circle. As the user tilts or moves the phone, the circles in motion responds to changes in the accelerometer.
